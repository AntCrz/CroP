CroP - Coordinated Panels Visualization Tool

CroP is a data visualization tool that utilizes coordinated multiple views to portray complex networks and multivariate data, in particular time-series. Through dynamic visualization models, CroP aims to highlight and analyze patterns of data, such as relationships between groups of data points, significant shifts in values, and different behaviors over time.

CroP is currently available as an executable jar file, along with sample datasets.
